##Features In Details##
1. **Packet Capture & Analysis**
* Real-Time Packet Sniffing – Capture network packets in real time using tools like scapy, tcpdump, or Wireshark.
* Protocol Analysis – Analyze protocols such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, ARP, and DNS.
* Packet Filtering – Capture only specific types of traffic (e.g., HTTP, SSH, DNS).
* Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) – Examine packet contents to detect security threats or application data.
* Packet Export & Storage – Save captured packets in PCAP format for offline analysis.

2. **Network Traffic Monitoring**
* Live Traffic Dashboard – Display real-time network traffic and statistics.
* Bandwidth Usage Monitoring – Measure network consumption per device or application.
* Traffic Categorization – Identify network traffic by source/destination IP, protocol, and port.
* Network Latency Analysis – Monitor response times and delays.
* Flow Analysis – Use NetFlow, sFlow, or IPFIX to track network traffic patterns.

3. **Network Performance & Diagnostics**
* Ping & Traceroute Integration – Diagnose connectivity and latency issues.
* Port Scanning – Identify open and vulnerable ports on the network.
* Latency & Jitter Measurement – Monitor delays and fluctuations in network response times.
* DNS Resolution Testing – Check the speed and accuracy of DNS lookups.
* SSL/TLS Certificate Monitoring – Detect expired or weak certificates.
* Packet Loss Analysis – Identify packet drops in network communication.

4. **Device & Host Monitoring**
* Active Host Discovery – Detect connected devices using ARP scanning or ICMP requests.
* Operating System Fingerprinting – Identify device OS using packet signatures.
* Network Topology Mapping – Visualize network connections and device relationships.
* SNMP Monitoring – Retrieve statistics from routers, switches, and other devices.
* Network Service Discovery – Detect running services on a device (e.g., SSH, FTP, HTTP).

##Future Features In Detail##
1. **Intrusion Detection & Security Analysis (AI Based)**
* Anomaly Detection – Identify unusual traffic patterns (e.g., port scanning, DDoS attacks).
* Signature-Based Threat Detection – Use predefined attack signatures to detect threats.
* MAC Address Monitoring – Detect unauthorized devices on the network.
* GeoIP Tracking – Map IP addresses to physical locations for security analysis.
* Firewall Log Analysis – Inspect firewall logs to detect blocked or suspicious traffic.
* DNS Query Monitoring – Detect domain lookups for potentially malicious sites.
* ARP Spoofing Detection – Identify potential man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

2. **Logs & Reporting**
* Real-Time Event Logging – Store network events, errors, and security incidents.
* Timed Log Rotation – Automatically archive and rotate logs daily or weekly.
* Custom Alerts & Notifications – Send alerts via email, Slack, or webhooks for specific events.
* Data Export – Save logs in CSV, JSON, or PCAP formats.
* Graphical Data Visualization – Use charts and graphs to display traffic trends and patterns.

3. **Automation & Integration**
* Scheduled Scans – Automate network scans at set intervals.
* API Support – Integrate with external monitoring tools like Prometheus, Splunk, or Grafana.
* Webhook Triggers – Send real-time notifications to security platforms.
* Machine Learning-Based Analysis – Use AI to detect advanced threats or anomalies.

4. **Wireless Network Monitoring**
* Wi-Fi Traffic Analysis – Capture and inspect wireless packets (802.11).
* Signal Strength Monitoring – Track Wi-Fi coverage and performance.
* Rogue Access Point Detection – Identify unauthorized Wi-Fi networks.
* Client Tracking – Monitor connected devices on the wireless network.
